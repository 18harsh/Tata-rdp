# Tata-rdp
<h3>
Develop a tool that can autonomously identify faculty & researchers in a given area of research. The tool must also generate their profiles using the provided template.
Teams are encouraged to design a comprehensive approach that includes scanning from academic institutions and other websites, integration with open-source repositories like google scholar, google patent, semantic scholar, and interfacing with relevant service providers.</h3>

# TASK
Participating teams must develop a tool which can scout for faculty members or researchers
active in a given research area. The participating teams must analyse potential techniques to
crawl online to identify and compile profiles of all such matches.

No ready dataset will be made available. Teams can use sample research themes and public
domain information to develop, validate, and demonstrate the solution.
